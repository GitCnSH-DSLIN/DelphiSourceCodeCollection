Grids_ts 2.20 for Delph 7 installation note

The TopGrid unit Grids_ts.pas is a slightly modified version of the standard Delphi Grids.pas unit and is not included with the installation of the TopGrid. 
This installation program uses the standard Delphi Grids.pas unit to recreate the source code file for the Grids_ts.pas unit by applying a few changes to the Grids.pas file.

Before running this installation program, you should place a valid copy of the Grids.pas unit in the TopGrid 'Source' subdirectory located under the installation directory chosen during setup of the TopGrid. 
When choosing the destination directory later during this setup, make sure you choose the TopGrid 'Source' subdirectory as the destination. 
You can find the Grids.pas unit in the 'Delphi6\Source\VCL' subdirectory. 
You MUST use the Delphi 7 Grids.pas unit, or the installation will not succeed. After running this installation program, remove the Grids.pas file from the TopGrid 'Source' subdirectory.

*** IMPORTANT ***

The copyright for the Grids.pas unit and the resulting Grids_ts.pas unit lie completely with Inprise Corporation and are subject to the terms and conditions of the Inprise license agreement for Delphi. 
This installation program applies a number of changes to the Grids.pas unit, resulting in the Grids_ts.pas unit, by automatic means. The installation program will not work without a valid copy of the Grids.pas unit.
