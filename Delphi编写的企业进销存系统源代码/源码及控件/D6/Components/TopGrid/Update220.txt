The following are the list of enhancements, defects fixed and known problems for 2.20 (beta 2)...

1. New properties on grids called PrintOrientation, PrintLinesPerPage and PrintTotals

2. New property on TtsCol called PrintTotals to specify if a grand total should be shown on the grid report for that column. PrintTotals property must be set to true for any column totals to appear.

The Print Preview will bring up the grid report preview window. The Print will print the grid report to the default printer immediately. The Export will display a save dialog to save as either CSV or XML. HTML must be done programmatically using the TtsHTMLGridProducer component.
* Note: If a PopupMenu is already associated with the grid, then setting the ProvideGridMenu to True will show the menu options at the bottom of the existing popup menu with a line separator.

4. Improved Combo editing to the Design Editor with a new easy to use interface - list of combos for just the combos used on the grid (no need to scroll the grid horizontally anymore). Easier property setting and field specifications for the columns of the dropdown.
* Note: StoredData entry is not available yet.

5. Fixed defect where adjusting the columns of a multi column combo did not take.

6. Fixed defect where LookupDatasource data was not being populated in the combo data grid.

7 New property grouping called Data within the grid property viewer to view just the data oriented properties of a TtsDbGrid.

9. Fixed defect where it was no longer possible to reference a column in the grid by the field name.

10. Fixed defect associated with Delphi 6 not being forgiving (like Delphi 5) on the AnsiCompareStr function. Was periodically causing an AV error when selecting the combo or during keyed entry.
